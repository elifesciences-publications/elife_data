The files contained in here are the processed data files used to infer the Potts models and annotated as below:

Protease (PR)
-------------
+ **pr.fullseq** : Alignment of our processed drug experienced HIV-1 subtype B Protease sequences (obtained from the Stanford HIVDB) in the full 20-letter amino acid. 
             
+ **pr.reduce4.seq** : Alignment of our processed drug-experienced HIV-1 subtype B Protease sequences in the reduced 4-letter (ABCD) amino acid alphabet as used to infer the Potts model.
                 
+ **pr.weights** : Sequence weights of individual sequences in pr.fullseq or pr.reduce4.seq. Sequences are given weights such that the effective number of sequences obtained from a single patient is 1.

Reverse Transcriptase (RT)
--------------------------
+ **rt.fullseq** : Alignment of our processed drug experienced HIV-1 subtype B RT sequences (obtained from the Stanford HIVDB) in the full 20-letter amino acid. 

+ **rt.reduce4.seq** : Alignment of our processed drug-experienced HIV-1 subtype B RT sequences in the reduced 4-letter (ABCD) amino acid alphabet as used to infer the Potts model.

+ **rt.weights** : Sequence weights of individual sequences in rt.fullseq or rt.reduce4.seq. Sequences are given weights such that the effective number of sequences obtained from a single patient is 1.
             
Integrase (IN)
--------------
+ **in.fullseq** : Alignment of our processed drug experienced HIV-1 subtype B IN sequences (obtained from the Stanford HIVDB) in the full 20-letter amino acid. 
             
+ **in.reduce4.seq** : Alignment of our processed drug-experienced HIV-1 subtype B IN sequences in the reduced 4-letter (ABCD) amino acid alphabet as used to infer the Potts model.
                 
+ **in.weights** : Sequence weights of individual sequences in in.fullseq or in.reduce4.seq. Sequences are given weights such that the effective number of sequences obtained from a single patient is 1.
